James Nangle - Student ID: 17338145

Brief: Interrogate the GitHub API to build visualisation of data available that elucidates some aspect of the 
softare engineering process, such as a social graph of developers and projects, or a visualisation of indiviudal 
or team performance. Provide a visualisation of this. 

Throughout this assignment I have use R-Studio to make use of various functionality of the GitHub API. A tutorial for integrating the GitHub API with R can be found at https://towardsdatascience.com/accessing-data-from-github-api-using-r-3633fb62cb08#.40dk13rdr 

I decided to choose a GitHub user with a more substantial following than myself in order to be able to extract a large amount of data. I produced simple visualisations of various GitHub metrics.
